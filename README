about acu, sometimes a twice-weekly newsletter for the acu community

[ whenever ]
- acuLine functions have been modified and renamed slightly

[ august 10 1999 ]
stuff from tom
- acApp and acWindow are one, and all of the apps are broken
  in between.
stuff from ben
- fixed bugs in polygon drawing code, thanks to casey, who
  tried using it for the first time since acu's inception
- windows version now supports jpeg. yay.

[ july 2 1999 ]
stuff from ben 
- acuScreenGrab (and subsequently acApp::screenGrab) can now write
  (hold your breath) ppm, raw, and (drum roll) tiff files. death to
  scrsave! die die die! documentation for using these fancy features
  can be found in the acu online documentation (acu.h) or from the
  forthcoming o'reilly book, now in draft form from our very own   
  casey reas. 
- fixed a number of bugs with the previously undocumented and unheard
  of acuReadRawFile, acuWriteRawFile, acuRecomponentArray and others.
  they're now briefly mentioned in the docs, read up, they could
  save you time and money.
- cleaned up acuTexRectf, which was having 'issues'.  
- additional fistfuls of minor bug fixes, many found by bug magnets
  jocelyn lin and bill keays.
stuff from tom
- theApp in acApp is now a static class member
- moved callback function defs to .h instead of .cpp

[ may 2 1999 ]
stuff from ben and tom
- more documentation and examples in acu.h
- video proxy now works with a string of jpeg files
- unified the sgi and windows codewarrior versions
- lots of windows porting stuff ironed out
- attempt to add jpeg to windows failed, will try again in a few weeks
- objective c stuff (acoApp) no longer in the main acu distribution
- added codewarrior project file
- lots of little cleanup things

[ mar 26 1999 ]
stuff from ben
- ABS(x) had a bug. oops.
- added acuSetInteger(ACU_TIME_STEP, step) so that people
  can slow down the time returned by acuCurrentTimeMillis.
- merged in the changes for the windows version of acu.
  these changes should make the mac version simpler as well.

[ mar 18 1999 ]
stuff from ben
- acu.h and acApp.h are finally documented.
- added acuColorHsb - fight the RGB tyranny!
- did some fixes/changes to the font stuff to get that
  behaving a little bit better (or failing more gracefully)
- misc bug fixes

[ feb 22 1999 ]
MESS AND CLEAN UP by Ben
- acApp function names all begin with lowercase.
- made acuGet/acuSet methods for ACU_SCREEN_FOV.
- removed acuSetMazoFov, acuMalloc, acuFree, acuRound 
  because they were silly.
- removed random comments and dead code.
- removed twod.c, since it only contained the line functions,
  and put it into 

[ feb 21 1999 ]
FIX by Tom
- Switched CANNOT_BIND_TEXTURES on for Golan
- Reorgainized /mas/acg/projects for stable acu development future


[ feb 20 1999 ]
ADDITION by Tom
- Added acoApp to libacu.a, which is the objective-C version of acApp
  * This adds libobjc to the things to link against, thought this should
    only matter to people using acoApp. See Makefile for more documentation.


[ feb 19 1999 ]
ADDITIONS/FIXES by Tom

- C/C++ cleanup. Made acu.h a straight C file, including extern C wrapper
- changed straight C files to file.c, C++ files now file.C
- moved acApp core into acu as that makes more sense


[ jan 29 1999 ]

ADDITIONS/FIXES IN THIS VERSION
- drawing fonts now take x, y positions. this is
  (hopefully) faster than calling glTranslatef for 
  each individual character.
- acVec3f has been modified and closer to its 
  final resting place. be warned, however, to use
  acVec3f at your own risk.


[ jan 25 1999 ]

ADDITIONS/FIXES IN THIS VERSION
- font support is now included
- reading & writing of jpeg files
- acuScreenGrab (mmmm... tasty...)

DEMOS/EXAMPLES/HOWTO
included, though in sort of a mess, are a few of my 
projects, rewritten for acu. among these are the following:
hsvspace6 - live demo of the hsv color cone (uses video input)
spinner2 - unfinished port of my java spinner applet (loads a jpeg file)
disgrand2 - gradient-sorting of colors in video input (uses 2d)

OTHER NOTES
- you need to include -ljpeg in your Makefile, to include the
jpeg library. look for a line that reads '-lGL -lXm -lglut' etc.
- you might not want to use acVec3f unless you really need it and 
are willing to rewrite code when its api changes over the next week
